# Test Cases from Group Project

I wrote 2 unit test functions with the names "test_ai_minor" and "test_business_minor". The following is a link to the code in the group project repository.

# What are the pros and cons of Test-Driven Development (TDD)?

TDD comes with its advantages and disadvantages. One advantage of TDD is that it causes you to create an application by creating micro features that need to pass a unit test. This ultimately leads to a modular design for the application. Another advantage of TDD is that it promotes high test coverage and  allows for the code to be easily reviewable because each micro function has its own unit test. TDD also demonstrates what the code is supposed to do and how itâ€™s supposed to be used, this allows for people to easily join the project because they will have numerous unit tests to help them understand how the code works. A disadvantage to TDD is that it can be time consuming because you need to write a test for each micro feature of the application, this can add up if the app has many micro features. Another issue with TDD being time consuming is that it can be difficult to meet deadlines while adhering to TDD, especially in a working environment that tries to release many features at once. Another disadvantage of TDD is that when project requirements change the unit tests that were previously written can become redundant and new unit tests and code will need to be made.
